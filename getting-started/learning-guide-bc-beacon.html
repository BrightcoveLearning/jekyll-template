    <p>Brightcove Beacon is a platform which enables you to create and configure media streaming experiences across multiple devices. With Brightcove Beacon you can curate your content, implement monetization strategies, and design viewer
      experiences. In doing so, you can:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Greatly reduces overall costs.The costs of developing apps for each platform are considerable, anywhere from $50K-$250K for a custom app targeted at just ONE platform. Brightcove Beacon allows creation of multiple apps from a single
        configured experience.</li>
      <li>Provides a consistent experience for viewers across all platforms.</li>
      <li>Allows monetization of video content via options like AVOD, SVOD and Pay Per View.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apps can be generated to run on the following four device types (some specific examples included):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile (Phone / Tablets)
        <ul>
          <li>Android</li>
          <li>iOS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Connected TVs
        <ul>
          <li>Android TV</li>
          <li>Apple TV</li>
          <li>Fire TV</li>
          <li>Roku</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Smart TVs
        <ul>
          <li>LG</li>
          <li>Panasonic</li>
          <li>Samsung</li>
          <li>Sony</li>
          <li>Toshiba</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- <li>Consoles
              <ul>
                <li>Playstation</li>
                <li>XBOX</li>
              </ul>
            </li> -->
      <li>Web</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Not only do you get multiple device apps from a single source, but Brightcove Beacon also allows you to control the content and layout for each device app from your single Brightcove Beacon Experience.</p>

    <p>Your specific device apps need only be submitted once to vendors for approval. Of course, you will want to change the media that is offered for viewing, but you may also wish to alter the app layout, or change your monetization for
      advertising strategy. The key to updating the app, but not having to resubmit to the vendor store lies in the architecture of Brightcove Beacon, is shown here:</p>

    <p>This architecture provides the functionality to only alter the single Brightcove Beacon Experience to update the layout or configuration of all your device apps.</p>
